# Specification Quality Checklist: LimbleConnector Spec-Driven Wrapper (Hybrid Option C)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [/] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (Remaining: 1)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] remains regarding handling of unknown response shapes. This is acceptable for a Draft but should be resolved before implementation.
- Success criteria SC-003 has a long time-horizon (12 months), which is hard to measure in a short-term CI, but serves as a guiding principle.
